            We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store
            your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when
            processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as
            long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After
            that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not
            saved.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
            managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
            Discover.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
            information by our store and its service providers. For more
